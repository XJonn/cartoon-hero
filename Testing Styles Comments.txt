<!-- Below is "Ruleset" styling. Think of it as pallets in MA2. It's more efficient when many things are the same -->
<!-- If there are 2 different styles within one group, the most recently written style takes prescedence -->
<!-- Below is also defining a "class" which is basically a style for different groups -->
<!-- Line 24 is bascally saying if you are a part of these both of these groups (classes), then you will be green -->
<!-- Line 28 & 29 basically say that if your in heading 1 and have span, then you will be red -->
	<style type="text/css"> 
		h1{
			font-size: 10px;
			color: #A600FF;	
		}

		.big{
			font-size: 60px;
		}

		.uppercase{
			text-transform: uppercase;
		}

		.big.uppercase{
			color: green;
		}

		h1 span{
			color: red;
		}


	</style>

	<span>span element</span>
	<h1 class="uppercase"><span>Heading 1</span> - 1</h1>
	<h1 class="big uppercase">Heading 1 - 2</h1> <!-- multiple classes -->
	<h1 class="big">Heading 1 - 3</h1>
	<h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: hotpink;">Heading 2 -1</h2> <!-- Having CSS written out is called inline styling -->
	<h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: hotpink;">Heading 2 -2</h2> <!-- all sperate attributes end with semicolon -->
	<h2 style="font-size: 20px; color: hotpink;">Heading 2 -3</h2> <!-- Color can be defined by Hex values or html color names -->
<!-- If you create a rulest, you can adjust individual parts. E.x. I can change color of Heading 1 - 1 by adding inline attributes, causing the rest of h1 to be the same except for Heading 1 - 1 (specific style takes prescendence) -->
